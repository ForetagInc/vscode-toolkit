All batteries are included: extensions, themes, languages, snippets and more.

## Themes

A collection of dark, light and high contrast Foretag's VSCode themes. The themes included are optimized for various languages such as Rust, TypeScript, GraphQL, YAML, TOML and JSON.

### Features
- Dark, light and high contrast variants

- UI focused towards MacOS and Linux*


*The theme also functions on other operating systems like Windows without a issue, but may not resemble the primary supported platforms.
